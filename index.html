        <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web
          browsers. Created by Netscape in 1995, it was initially intended to add small-scale interactivity to web
          pages. Over time, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful, versatile, and efficient language capable of
          handling complex logic, animations, and event-driven functionalities. With the advent of JavaScript engines
          like V8 and Node.js, it's now used on both the front end (in the browser) and the back end (on servers),
          making it essential for web development and a core technology alongside HTML and CSS.</p>

          Before diving into JavaScript, some prerequisites will help you understand concepts more easily:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language): It's beneficial to know the basics of HTML, as JavaScript often interacts
            with HTML elements to create dynamic web pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A fundamental understanding of CSS will help, as JavaScript can manipulate
            styles to change the appearance of elements on a page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic Programming Concepts: Familiarity with basic concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and
            conditional statements will be advantageous. Although JavaScript introduces unique concepts, many principles
            are universal.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are two distinct programming languages with different syntaxes, use cases, and behaviors,
          despite having similar names. JavaScript is dynamically typed, prototype-based, and primarily used for
          client-side scripting. Java, on the other hand, is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language
          used in server-side applications, Android development, and large-scale systems. While Java must be compiled
          before running, JavaScript code is interpreted, making it faster for smaller applications. Knowing the
          differences can help avoid confusion between the two languages and clarify that learning one does not directly
          translate to learning the other.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The classic "Hello, World!" example is often used as a simple introduction to a programming language. In
          JavaScript, you can write this in various ways to display a message on a web page or in the browser console.
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          // Your code here
          function example() {
          console.log("This is a block of code.");
          }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this example, JavaScript waits until the HTML document has fully loaded, then displays "Hello, World!"
          inside the div element.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. These values can be modified and accessed throughout
          the code, making variables fundamental to any programming. JavaScript has three main ways to declare
          variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            var: This is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript, with function scope rather than block
            scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            let: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let allows you to declare block-scoped variables, making it safer
            for use in loops and conditionals.
          </li>
          <li>
            const: Also introduced in ES6, const declares a constant, read-only variable, which means its value cannot
            be changed after initial assignment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Declaring variables in JavaScript requires a keyword (var, let, or const) followed by the variable name. Here
          are examples:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          var name = "Alice";     // Declares a function-scoped variable
          let age = 25;           // Declares a block-scoped variable
          const country = "USA";  // Declares a block-scoped constant
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Using let and const is now the preferred approach for better control of scope. const should be used for values
          that remain constant, like configuration values or mathematical constants.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Scope defines where variables can be accessed or used in JavaScript. JavaScript has three types of scope:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block have a global scope, meaning they can be
            accessed anywhere in the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function are accessible only within that function.
          </li>
          <li>
            Block Scope: Variables declared with let or const within a block (such as in loops or conditionals) are only
            accessible within that block. This was introduced to prevent issues like unexpected variable modification in
            loops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variable">
      <header>Global variable</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Global variables are accessible throughout the entire codebase, making them useful for values that need to be
          referenced frequently. However, overusing global variables can lead to code conflicts and bugs, especially in
          larger applications. In modern JavaScript, global variables should be minimized and, if needed, encapsulated
          to prevent unexpected behavior.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Constants are variables that cannot be reassigned after they are set. They provide a way to declare values
          that should remain unchanged, which can help prevent errors in your code. JavaScript uses const to declare
          constants, which are block-scoped:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const MAX_USERS = 100;
            const API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Once declared, attempting to reassign a constant will result in an error.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          JavaScript supports multiple data types, which can be loosely categorized into two types: Primitive Types and
          Reference Types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primitive Types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>String: "Hello"</li>
          <li>Number: 42 or 3.14</li>
          <li>Boolean: true or false</li>
          <li>Undefined: A declared variable without an assigned value</li>
          <li>Null: A deliberate non-value</li>
          <li>Symbol: A unique identifier (introduced in ES6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reference Types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Objects: A collection of key-value pairs</li>
          <li>Arrays: An ordered list of values</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="If_else_statement">
      <header>If else statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The if-else statement is a control structure that allows you to execute code based on a condition:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let temperature = 30;
            if (temperature > 25) {
                console.log("It's hot outside.");
            } else if (temperature < 15) {
                console.log("It's cold outside.");
            } else {
                console.log("The weather is mild.");
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The if block runs if the condition is true; otherwise, the else block runs. Additional conditions can be
          checked with else if statements.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
      <header>While statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            let count = 0;
            while (count < 5) {
                console.log("Count is: " + count);
                count++;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this example, the while loop increments count and prints it, stopping once count reaches 5.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called to perform a specific task. Declaring functions in
          JavaScript is done using the function keyword:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            function multiply(a, b) {
                return a * b;
            }
            console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          JavaScript functions allow parameter passing and return values, making them versatile for code organization.
          Functions can also be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
        </p>
